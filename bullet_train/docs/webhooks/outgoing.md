# Outgoing Webhooks

## Introduction
Webhooks allow for users to be notified via HTTP request when activity takes place on their team in your application. Bullet Train applications include an entire user-facing UI that allows them not only to subscribe to webhooks, but also see a history of their attempted deliveries and debug delivery issues.

## Default Event Types
Bullet Train can deliver webhooks for any model you've added under `Team`. We call the model a webhook is being issued for the "subject". 

An "event type" is a subject plus an action. By default, every model includes `created`, `updated`, and `destroyed` event types. These are easy for us to implement automatically because of [Active Record Callbacks](https://guides.rubyonrails.org/active_record_callbacks.html).

## Custom Event Types
You can make custom event types available for subscription by adding them to `config/models/webhooks/outgoing/event_types.yml`. For example:

```yaml
payment:
  - attempting
  - succeeded
  - failed
```

Once the event type is configured, you can make your code actually issue the webhook like so:

```ruby
payment.generate_webhook(:succeeded)
```

## Delivery
Webhooks are delivered asyncronously in a background job by default. If the resulting HTTP request results in a status code other than those in the 2XX series, it will be considered a failed attempt and delivery will be reattempted a number of times.

## Versioning
Endpoints are configured with a reference to a specific version of the API. By default this option is not visible in the application because there is only a "V1" version of the API. However, when you [bump API versions](/docs/api/versioning.md) from "V1" to "V2" for the first time, this option appears. 

Any time you bump API versions, an existing endpoint will continue to receive payloads for the API version it was configured to receive until the user specifically chooses to update it to the newest version of the API. New endpoints will default to the newest version of the API available.

## Future Plans
 - Allow users to filter webhooks to be generated by a given parent model. For example, they should be able to subscribe to `post.created`, but only for `Post` objects created within a certain `Project`.
 - Integrate [Hammerstone Refine](https://hammerstone.dev) to allow even greater configurability for filtering webhooks.
